excerpt: "Completed Sept. 30th, 2022"

A timid and cowardly, Ryland Grace was a pure and good man. Even as a scientist, pure curiosity, passion, and good intentions overcame his fears. 
He constantly longed for survival, but in the face of the final conflict, he chose friendship over survival. 
A coward's friendship aroused a goodwill that even surpass his fears. 
It was an interesting read, and I hope you all check the ending.
