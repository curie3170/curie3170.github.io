Hello, I am Curie Kim, currently working as a Research Scientist at [the ACSL](https://uehwan.github.io/) of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST).
I am focusing on deep learning, especially 3D computer vision and SLAM for autonomous driving and robot vision.

Before joining GIST, I worked for 20 months as a CMOS image sensor software developer at Samsung Electronics' Advanced Sensor Development Team.
I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Jong-Hwan Kim at [the RIT Lab](https://rit.kaist.ac.kr/).
I recieved my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in 2019. 

I also love to crossfit, freediving, hiking and camping!
