### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hello, I am a 1st year Computer Science PhD student working with professor [Cunxi Yu](https://ycunxi.github.io/cunxiyu/), in Univerity of Maryland, College Park. I am focusing on utilizing machine learning in circuit reasoning and designing circuits as an application of Electronic Design Automation. 

Before joining UMD, I worked for 2 years as a CMOS image sensor software developer at [Samsung Electronics](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/image-sensor/)' Advanced Sensor Development Team. I earned my M.S., and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Electrical Engineering from Korea University respectively. 

I also love to crossfit, freediving, hiking and camping!
