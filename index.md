Hello, I am a 1st year Computer Science PhD student in [PRG Lab](https://prg.cs.umd.edu), Univerity of Maryland, College Park. I am focusing on deep learning, especially 3D computer vision, point cloud applications for autonomous driving and robot vision. 

Before joining UMD, I worked for 2 years as a CMOS image sensor software developer at [Samsung Electronics](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/image-sensor/)' Advanced Sensor Development Team and worked for 1 year as  a Research Scientist at [the ACSL](https://uehwan.github.io/) of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST).
I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Jong-Hwan Kim at [the RIT Lab](https://rit.kaist.ac.kr/).
I recieved my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in 2019. 

I also love to crossfit, freediving, hiking and camping!
