The model is designed in Auto CAD as shown in Figure 2.1(a) and (b), which consists of
the chassis, two wheels, a box to protect the components, a blade with 3 holes for
sensors to emit and receive light and a sharp knife connected to the lower edge of it to
help fit surface perfectly. The knife would let the opponet drive onto it so that thrust
from the opposite could be alleviate.


Electrical Design
==============
* Components checklist is shown below:
- 1 Arduino Mega 2560
- 2 Parallax continuous Servo motors
- 1 Sharp IR distance sensor 10 - 150cm, 5V operating
- 2 Sharp IR proximity sensors 0.5 - 5cm
- 3 QTI sensors
- 3 LEDs
- 2 buttons
- Resistors and capacitors
- 1 non-rechargeable 9V battery
- 4 AA batteries 1.5V
